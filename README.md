# Data-Structures
  ---
  Each class within this project emphasizes modularity, performance and usability. Key features includes manual implementation, generic types for flexibility and comprehensive unit tests using Xunit. 
  
  Functionalities like array manipulation, sorting algorithms and read-only access are included. Exception handling ensures proper error management and safe usage of data structures.

  Technologies used comprise C#, Xunit for unit testing and object-oriented programming principles. Generics are leveraged for handling various data types and sorting algorithms maintain sorted order efficiently.
