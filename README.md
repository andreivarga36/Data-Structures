# Data-Structures
  
  Key features includes manual implementation, generic types for flexibility and comprehensive unit tests using Xunit. 
  
  Functionalities like array manipulation, sorting algorithms and read-only access are included. Exception handling ensures proper error management and safe usage of data structures.

  Technologies used comprise C#, Xunit for unit testing and object-oriented programming principles. Generics are leveraged for handling various data types and sorting algorithms maintain sorted order efficiently.
